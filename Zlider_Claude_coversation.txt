I interested in as a presentation tool (on windows) create a desktop  app that uses browser tabs and desktop windows as slides. In one sense it would act as a bookmarker with navigation buttons. It would necessarily always need to be on top, but not take up much space. What is the feasibility of this project?

This is a feasible project with some interesting technical considerations! Let me break down the key aspects:

Technical Feasibility: High
Core Requirements:

Creating an always-on-top window in Windows is straightforward with most desktop frameworks
Opening and controlling browser tabs is achievable through browser automation
Managing desktop windows can be done via Windows API calls
Building a compact UI with navigation controls is simple
Implementation Approaches:

Electron/Tauri - Best fit for your use case
Built-in Chromium means you can directly render web content
Native window management capabilities
Can stay on top with alwaysOnTop flag
Cross-platform bonus
Can control external browsers via protocols
C# with WPF/WinForms
Excellent Windows integration
Can use TopMost property for always-on-top
Can launch browsers and control windows via Windows API
Good for a lightweight native app
Python (PyQt/Tkinter)
Rapid prototyping
Libraries like pygetwindow for window management
Can control browsers via Selenium/Playwright
Key Challenges:

Browser control: You can't directly control tabs in someone's existing browser session. You'd either need to launch new browser windows for each slide, or embed web content in your app
Window positioning: Bringing specific desktop windows to focus requires Windows API access (achievable but needs some work)
State persistence: Saving presentation configurations and bookmarks is straightforward
Recommended Architecture:

A small always-on-top control panel (maybe 200x100px) that can:

Launch browser windows at specific URLs
Bring designated windows to the foreground
Navigate between "slides" in sequence
Minimize to just navigation arrows when not in use
This would take a competent developer maybe 1-2 weeks to build a functional prototype. Would you like guidance on getting started with a specific technology stack?

Considering Browser control: 'You can't directly control tabs in someone's existing browser session. You'd either need to launch new browser windows for each slide, or embed web content in your app' - but i can alt+tab through windows and ctrl+tab through my browser tabs. Cant we use that as a starting point?

Ah, excellent point! Yes, you absolutely can use keyboard automation as your control mechanism. This actually simplifies things considerably and makes it much more feasible.

Keyboard Automation Approach
How it would work:

Your always-on-top controller app would send keyboard commands to Windows:

Alt+Tab to switch between application windows
Ctrl+Tab to cycle through browser tabs
Ctrl+Shift+Tab to go backwards through tabs
Alt+Esc as an alternative window switcher
Advantages:

Works with ANY browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
User can set up their tabs/windows however they want
No need to launch or manage windows yourself
Very lightweight implementation
Respects the user's existing workflow
Implementation:

In Python, you could use pynput or keyboard libraries:

python
from pynput.keyboard import Controller, Key
keyboard = Controller()

# Switch to next tab
keyboard.press(Key.ctrl)
keyboard.press(Key.tab)
keyboard.release(Key.tab)
keyboard.release(Key.ctrl)
In C#, you'd use SendKeys or Windows Input Simulator.

Enhanced Version:

You could even make it smarter by:

Recording which window/tab combination represents each "slide"
Using Alt+Tab to get to the right window, then Ctrl+Tab X times to reach the specific tab
Letting users "rehearse" their presentation path once, then replay it with simple forward/back buttons
This is actually more elegant than trying to control browsers directly. The app becomes a simple macro/hotkey manager for presentations. Very doable - maybe even just a few days of work for a basic version!

Would you want it to just be "dumb" navigation (always sends the same keys), or "smart" (remembers which windows/tabs correspond to each slide)?

Of course I would want it smarter if possible. Optimal would be if the user could design her zlideshow in advance, perhaps have some visual indicators for each zlide. (i will refer to tabs and windows as zlides going forwards). Maybe the previous zlide and the following zlide could be visible to help with orientation. Perhaps this is a step too far, but just imagine a user putting together her zlideshow at home and coming to a presentation with no browsers or apps open on her lap top, start up her zlide app and actually have the zlide app open up her zlides for her. I would image the zlider app should have minimal editing capabilites for ordering, deleting, etc. How do browser bookmarks work? I assume they just record urls. Right? for windows zlides I assume aliases/shortcuts would work. You tell me.

You're thinking about this really well! This is absolutely doable and the vision is getting clearer. Let me address your points:

Zlide Types & Storage
Browser Zlides (Tabs):

Yes, bookmarks are just URLs plus metadata (title, favicon, folder structure)
Your app would store: {url: "https://example.com", title: "Intro Slide", type: "browser"}
The app could open these in new tabs automatically
Application/Window Zlides:

Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) contain: executable path, arguments, working directory
Your app would store: {path: "C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe", args: "--file document.pdf", type: "application"}
Or for specific files: {path: "C:\\Users\\You\\presentation.pptx", type: "file"}
Smart Zlideshow Features
Pre-designed Zlideshow:

Zlideshow: "Q4 Results Presentation"
1. [Browser] Dashboard - https://analytics.company.com
2. [Browser] Revenue Charts - https://docs.google.com/...
3. [App] Excel Spreadsheet - budget.xlsx
4. [Browser] Competitor Analysis - internal link
5. [App] PowerPoint - summary.pptx
Visual Preview System:

Each zlide shows a thumbnail/icon + title
Current zlide highlighted in center
Previous zlide dimmed on left, next zlide on right
Could even capture screenshots when building the zlideshow for visual reference
The Workflow
At Home (Building Mode):

User opens Zlider app
Clicks "Add Zlide" → options appear:
"Current Browser Tab" (captures active tab URL)
"Browser URL" (manual entry)
"Application/File" (file picker)
"Desktop Window" (shows list of currently open windows to capture)
Zlides appear in a list with drag-to-reorder
Can add titles, delete, rearrange
Save as "Q4_Presentation.zlides"
At Presentation (Playback Mode):

Fresh laptop, nothing open
Launch Zlider, select "Q4_Presentation.zlides"
Click "Start Presentation"
App automatically:
Opens browser with first URL tabs
Launches applications/files as needed
Brings first zlide to focus
Compact controller stays on top with:
← Previous | Current Zlide Title (3/12) | Next →
Thumbnail previews of prev/current/next
Technical Implementation
Storage Format (JSON):

json
{
  "name": "Q4 Results",
  "zlides": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "browser",
      "url": "https://...",
      "title": "Dashboard",
      "screenshot": "base64..." // optional
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "file",
      "path": "C:\\Users\\...\\budget.xlsx",
      "title": "Budget Breakdown"
    }
  ]
}
Smart Navigation:

When moving to next zlide, app knows if it needs to Ctrl+Tab (same browser) or Alt+Tab (different window)
Tracks which zlide is currently active
Can even detect if windows are still open or need to be relaunched
Challenges to Consider:

Window tracking - Identifying which window corresponds to which zlide (can use window titles, process names)
Browser management - Opening multiple tabs in sequence, keeping track of tab order
Portability - File paths might break if presented on different machine (could use relative paths or warn user)
This is definitely achievable! I'd estimate 2-3 weeks for a solid MVP with all these features. The hardest part is reliable window/tab tracking, but even that's solvable.

Would you want to start with a prototype? I could help you sketch out the core architecture or even build a basic proof-of-concept.

You have captured the essence of what i am trying to do. If we can do a prototype or a poc, that would be fantastic.

15:04
Excellent! Let's build a proof-of-concept. I'll create a Python-based prototype since it's quick to develop and has good libraries for this use case.

Tech Stack for POC:
Python with Tkinter (built-in GUI)
pynput for keyboard automation
pygetwindow for window management
webbrowser module for opening URLs
JSON for storing zlideshow data
Let me create a functional prototype that demonstrates the core features:

Zlider - Presentation Zlideshow POC
Code 
Perfect! I've created a working POC for Zlider. Here's what this prototype demonstrates:

Features Implemented:
Building Mode:

✅ Add browser zlides (URLs)
✅ Add file zlides (documents, presentations, etc.)
✅ Edit zlide titles
✅ Delete zlides
✅ Reorder zlides (move up/down)
✅ Save/load zlideshow files (.zlides format)
Presentation Mode:

✅ Opens all zlides automatically when starting presentation
✅ Always-on-top controller window
✅ Shows previous/current/next zlide for orientation
✅ Navigation buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last)
✅ Zlide counter (e.g., "3/12")
To Run This POC:
Save the code as zlider.py
Install if needed: pip install pygetwindow (though this POC doesn't use it yet)
Run: python zlider.py
What Works Now:
Complete zlideshow editor
Automatic opening of browser tabs and files
Controller window that stays on top
Visual preview of prev/current/next zlides
What's Simulated (for next iteration):
The actual keyboard automation (Ctrl+Tab, Alt+Tab) - currently shows message boxes
Window tracking and focus management
Screenshot capture for thumbnails
Next Steps to Make it Production-Ready:
Would you like me to add:

Actual keyboard automation using pynput to send Ctrl+Tab/Alt+Tab?
Window tracking to intelligently know whether to tab-switch or window-switch?
Thumbnail screenshots when creating zlides?
Compact mode for the controller (minimal UI)?
Try it out and let me know what you think!
